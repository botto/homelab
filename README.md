# Homelab
This will document and contain all docs, scripts and tools required to run my homelab.  
I will try and ensure each feature has a readme.  

## Basics
The base of my set up is unraid, probably for a long time unless a better solution comes along or I make my own.  
Each feature will try to avoid too much unraid specifics but for now they will all have a base requirment of unraid.  

### Base requirments for the unraid setup:
- Community apps plugin(https://forums.unraid.net/topic/38582-plug-in-community-applications/)

## Featurs

- [Nomad](/nomad)
